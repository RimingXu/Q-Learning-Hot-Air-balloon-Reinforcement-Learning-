# Q-Learning-Hot-Air-balloon-Reinforcement-Learning-
In this project I programmed a Q-learning algorithm and used it to play a simple game. The goal was to gain better insight into Q-learning, and see in action such concepts as exploration-vs-exploitation, choice of parameters, limitations of discrete world, etc. It was fun to see AI controlling an agent.
